## Assignment
A local library wants to modernize its book tracking system. They have hired you to build the backend for a new “Digital Bookshelf” application. Your first task is to create a RESTful API that allows librarians to manage their book inventory. This API must support creating new book records, viewing the list of all books, finding a specific book by its ID, updating a book’s information, and removing a book from the collection.
